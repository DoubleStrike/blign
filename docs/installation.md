Then select Add-ons and from there click install and choose blign.py from wherever it is installed on your computer. Once installed, be sure to check the box on the left-hand side to enable the add-on. From there, Blign can be accessed in the N-Panel (by pressing the n key) under the Geometry sidebar.
